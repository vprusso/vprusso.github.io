Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Vincent Russo

I am a computer scientist specializing in the field of quantum information theory.

I have over a decade of experience in creating robust software solutions and have worked in a wide variety of technical
domains, including cryptography, GPU-driven research, numerical optimization, web, and automation services.
Additionally, I have published several peer-reviewed journal articles in areas including computer science and quantum
information.

Papers, presentations, and software on my research may be found on my [publications](/publications) page.

I enjoy working on developing various [software projects](/projects).
I am presently the CEO and co-founder of [Modellicity](https://www.modellicity.com/); a company focused on delivering software solutions to clients in the financial space and abroad.

When I'm not programming or doing research, I like to [play guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpjVJ76pLMY), [teach programming](http://bit.ly/lucidcode), [read books](https://www.goodreads.com/captainhampton), and [play Jurassic Park II on SNES really quickly](http://speeddemosarchive.com/JurassicPark2SNES.html).
