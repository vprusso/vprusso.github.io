Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Vincent Russo (PhD).

I am a computer scientist specializing in the field of quantum computation.

My primary research interests pertain to solving mathematical and computational problems within the field of quantum
information theory. Specifically, I leverage the tools of matrix analysis, linear algebra, and convex optimization along
with my software development skills and experience to tackle questions in the theory of quantum entanglement and quantum
information [(papers)](/papers).

I have over a decade of experience in creating robust software solutions and have worked in a wide variety of technical
domains, including cryptography, GPU-driven research, numerical optimization, scientific programming, web, and
automation services ([code](/code)).

When I'm not programming or doing research, I like to [play guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpjVJ76pLMY),
[teach](http://bit.ly/lucidcode), [read](https://www.goodreads.com/captainhampton), [write](/posts), and [play Jurassic
Park II on SNES really quickly](http://speeddemosarchive.com/JurassicPark2SNES.html).

If youâ€™d like to reach out to me, I can be contacted via vincentrusso1(at)gmail.com.
