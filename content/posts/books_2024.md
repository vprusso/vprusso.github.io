There's a [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuvKdE5e3eo&ab_channel=MaximilianMontserrat) in Cosmos (the good one
with Carl Sagan) where he is at the public library in New York City. It's a massive building filled with books. Sagan
begins talking about how many books you could read if you read one book each week. He takes a few steps in front of some
bookshelves he's standing in front of and stops shortly after. The entirety of one's reading life is contained within a
few humble steps of an enormous library. "The trick", he says, "to read the right ones".

In 2024, I read [over 100 books](https://www.goodreads.com/readingchallenges/gr/annual/2024). I say this not to brag but
more so to highlight a glaring deficiency in my own habits and prioritization. I suppose I am perpetually overwhelmed at
the sheer number of amazing books out there and the prospect that I'll never be able to read and experience them all. I
try to compensate with quantity, but 2025 will be about quality. I'll be trying to focus exclusively on "the right
ones".

That's not to say that 2024 was focused on reading low quality books, far from it. I feel as if I read many impactful
books that deeply changed my thought process. Perhaps I just feel like those high-value books didn't get the
appropriate amount of "pondering" time post-read they deserved. Indeed, I will explicilty list and elaborate on
these books below. I feel that the majority of the books that I read did not hit that mark, in fact, many of them were
"guilt completion reads"; books that I felt needed to be finished because I started them.

### My top 5 books of 2024

These are in no particular ranked order.

- *["My Childhood"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/163620.My_Childhood)* by Maxim Gorky

I picked this up at a local bookstore, following the owner's advice, when looking for Russian literature. I had not previously
heard of Gorky, so I went into this book blind. This stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the writing of other well-known
Russians (i.e., Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, etc.).

It is a tragic story of trauma, violence, and strife written as an autobiography. While the other Russian writers came
from some higher place in Russian society, Gorky gives us a view of the state of common life during the same time
period. It's the pure embodiment of the Russian soul and spirit, and this book's writing is gripping and beautiful.

There's a quote that I think does a good job of encapsulating the spirit of the text:

> "Long afterwards I came to understand that Russians, as a result of the poverty and dullness of their lives, sought
diversion in grief, playing it up like children, and rarely feeling ashamed of their misfortunes. When life is
monotonous, even grief is a welcome event, even a fire is diversion. A wart is adornment to a vaccous face."

In researching this text, I also stumbled on what I think was a [really great
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yhhQznEhE&ab_channel=TheActiveMind) that showcases this book.

- *["The Denial of Death"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2761.The_Denial_of_Death)* by Ernest Becker

This is not the most uplifting of reads, but, a necessary one, I think. For me, this book tore off the blindfold of my
all-too-human repression of death. 

- *["Savage Gods"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44788820-savage-gods)* by Paul Kingsnorth

Kingsnorth talks about writing and escaping to a more rural area to live with his family. I'd say this is a
"meta-memoir" on writing and one that is worth reading not only for aspiring writers but for anyone who strives to be
authentic and deliberate in their thinking, actions, and speech. 

This has also led me down a bit of a Kingsnorth rabbit hole and I've been enjoying his talks and writing on technology
and his journey to Greek Orthodoxy.

- *["Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74034.Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death)* by Neil Postman

It might be easy to dismiss this book before diving into it by assuming that Postman is a Luddite or that he is
promoting the message that "television is bad, mmkay?". His point is much subtler than that and one that I think
articulates the fears that have largely come to pass and become amplified by the technological advancement of the
computer, the internet, and social media. Postman passed away in 2003, so many of these insights did not make it into
this book, but it is not difficult to extrapolate from his writing.

A vital point of this book is that in Orwell vs. Huxley, they proposed two very different dystopian societies. Orwell
warned his readers against government control and Big Brother, whereas Huxley's view was endless self-amusement. There
is no conspiracy or over-arching thought-police, but instead, a world where people are selected to be in a constant
state of amusement and distraction. This is the state worth being concerned about and this appears to be the trajectory
that we are presently on.

- *["All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34760.All_I_Really_Need_to_Know_I_Learned_in_Kindergarten)* by Robert Fulghum

I’m a big fan of Robert’s writing. It’s terse but dense in terms of content and life lessons. All of his stories end
with a gut punch of saccharin goodness. A few repeated short stories from other books of his, but those were worth
reading again.

### My top 5 to-reads in 2025

The following books are heffers and ones that I feel like I have read in some form simply due to the osmosis in which
these books have pervaded multiple domains. Still, the broad brush strokes of the ideas within are only a topical view
within. 

This list is a "soft" list that I'm not going to too stringently hold myself to. The 2025 reading list will certainly
contain much more than this, but I would feel content having experienced the depth that I know these books have to
offer.

* *["The Brothers Karamazov"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4934.The_Brothers_Karamazov)* by Fyodor Dostoevsky

I started this a while back but did not finish. My wife got me a nice hardcover edition of this book which I'll be
starting fresh from. I am aware of the "punchline" of this book, namely, the dichotomy between Ivan and Alyosha and
Dostoevsky's implication that despite Ivan's wit, Alyosha was the "correct" one. At least, this is my high-level
impression of it now, and perhaps it will change as I read it. I know that Dostoevsky used these characters to battle
his own inner thoughts on the matter of religion.

* *["The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes--and Its Implications"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/177068.The_Fabric_of_Reality)* by David Deutsch

As one of the pioneers in my field, I feel a sense of obligation to read more of Deutsch's writings. His expositions on
quantum information and pedagogical lectures on the topic were instrumental for my own decision to pursue this area of
research.

* *["Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach)* by Douglas R. Hofstadter

I'm honestly surprised that I haven't read this one by now. Given all of the references to this book in countless
podcasts, etc., I feel like I should actually take the time to go through it. I'm sure many of the themes are so
prevalent now in other forms as to become trite, but I still would like to read through it for the sake of completeness.

* *["Ulysses"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_5)* by James Joyce

I actually already started reading this. While I appreciate the writing and style, I simply don't have the requisite
literature background to fully appreciate all the references to the Odyssey and subtleties of the writing. Truly, it's
even difficult to know what is happening during certain scenes due to the "stream of consciousness" writing that Joyce
employs. I've found that reading a chapter first and then consulting the [Ulysses guide](https://www.ulyssesguide.com/)
to be a helpful way of deciphering the text.

* *["Lord of the Rings (trilogy)"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33.The_Lord_of_the_Rings)* by J.R.R. Tolkien

I've seen the movies but never read the books. I have read "The Hobbit", but that was many moons ago. While I am
certainly familiar with the primary story arch (due to cultural osmosis and the movie trilogy), I am excited to read
the actual texts as J.R.R. Tolkien appears to have been a massively multi-dimensional and fascinating character and
writer.

I'm looking forward to diving into these books, along with many others. If you're a fellow reader and have a Goodreads
