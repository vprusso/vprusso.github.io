### Mentoring

---

I have been priviledged to have many caring and intelligent teachers, mentors, bosses, and role models in my life. I try
to pay this gift forward by sharing my time and knowledge with others, although my debt remains.

- [LucidProgramming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFxcvyt2Ucq5IL0_1Njzqlg)  
    The LucidProgramming YouTube channel is where I post various instructional videos on software development topics.

- [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.educative.io/courses/ds-and-algorithms-in-python)    
    I partnered with Educative to produce a course to teach data structures and algorithms in Python.

### Podcasts

---

I'd like to do more podcasting. If you want to talk quantum computing, feel free to reach out to me.

- [Nonlocal Podcast](https://nonlocal.libsyn.com/)   
    Co-host of the "Nonlocal Podcast"; a podcast about various aspects of quantum computing.


### Music

---

Throughout the years I've played lots of shows in many bands and recorded some of it along the way. Most of these are
non-deliberately lo-fi recordings due to them being basement tapes recorded many moons ago. A few of them, however, are
from professional recording studios and therefore have higher sound fidelity. The following is only a small sampling of
recordings as many have been lost to the sands of time.

- [captainhampton](https://www.youtube.com/@captainhampton):  
    YouTube channel featuring guitar videos.

- [Four Way Stop](https://soundcloud.com/captainhampton/sets/four-way-stop):   
    This is the name that I've had for my solo project for years with a large spectrum of musical styles.

- [Fatherbodies](https://fatherbodies.bandcamp.com/album/just-drunk-enough):   
    A crusty punk band that I played with for about a year here. 

- [Garden Weather](https://soundcloud.com/captainhampton/sets/garden-weather):   
    A bit different than my other music, but many good times and good friends made.
    
- [Summerwake](https://soundcloud.com/captainhampton/braveheart):   
    More mainstream sounding than my other music, but a fun band with great people.

- [Satellites over Moscow](https://soundcloud.com/captainhampton/sets/satellites-over-moscow):   
    Some overlap of the members from Summerwake with a similar style.

- [Saved by Whales](https://soundcloud.com/captainhampton/saved-by-whales-ageless):   
    A one-trick-pony "band" with some friends. We recorded the intro with a nailfile on a guitar.

- [Light up the Night](https://soundcloud.com/captainhampton/sets/light-up-the-night):   
    Unlike the other bands, I decided to play bass in this one. 

- [Russo and Russo](https://soundcloud.com/captainhampton/sets/russo-and-russo):   
    My brother is an actual musician ([Castle
    Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUVGHk9yRAs&ab_channel=CastleBlackMusic), [Kissyface Fashion Faux
    Pas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0nuiHW2jg&ab_channel=GenereJumper), [Russo and
    Kelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPCydW8M9S8&ab_channel=WDET101.9FMDetroit), etc.), but we have made a few
    songs together.

- [The Silent Art of Murder](https://soundcloud.com/captainhampton/sets/the-silent-art-of-murder):   
    Heavily influenced (although a far cry from) [At the Gates](), [Black Dahlia Murder](),
and for some reason [Chrono Trigger]() from SNES. One of my highschool bands.

- [First Place Loser](https://soundcloud.com/captainhampton/sets/first-place-loser):   
    My first "serious" band in early highschool.
