            Hello! I'm Vincent Russo.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am presently the CEO and co-founder of <a href="">Modellicity</a>; a
            company focused on delivering software solutions to clients in the
            financial space and abroad.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hold a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Waterloo
            and a Bachelors and Masters in computer science from Wayne State
            University.
        </p>

        <p> 
            I have over a decade of experience in creating robust software
            solutions and have worked in a wide variety of technical domains
            including cryptography, GPU-driven research, numerical optimization,
            web, and automation services. Additionally I have published several
            peer reviewed journal articles in areas including computer science
            and quantum information.
        </p>

        <p> 
            Papers, presentations, and software on my research may be found on my <a href="/publications">publications</a> page.
        </p>

        <p> 
            I enjoy working on developing various <a href="/projects">software projects</a>. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            When I'm not programming or doing research, I like to 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpjVJ76pLMY">play guitar</a>, 
            <a href="http://bit.ly/lucidcode">teach programming</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/captainhampton">read books</a>, 
            <a href="http://speeddemosarchive.com/JurassicPark2SNES.html">and play Jurassic Park II on SNES really quickly.</a>
